# Research on using different Deep Learning models for forecasting Buildings' Energy consumbtion
## Note: _the paper is under review for the IEEE SouthEast Conference_
### The research was conducted by me and [Menna Nawar](https://github.com/mennanawar) using the ASHRAE dataset provided by kaggle.
### You can find the Paper [here on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10663).

---------------------------------------

### In this research We've:
- introduced a new transfer learning method that can help with forecasting the energy consumption of buildings with scarce data
- compared our method with the well-known machine learning and deep learning models used for timeseries forecasting
- compared the performance of the before/after using our introduced technique

### Hopefully this way would increase the amount of research done in the field of transfer learning and utilizing it better in different fields.
